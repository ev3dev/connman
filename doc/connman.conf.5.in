.SH NAME
main.conf \- ConnMan configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @sysconfdir@/connman/main.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
.B main.conf
is a configuration file for ConnMan. The configuration file is
optional but it can be used to set up various aspects of ConnMan's
behavior. The location of the file may be changed through use of
the \fB\-\-config= \fRargument for \fBconnman\fP(8).
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.P
The configuration file format is key file format.
It consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs.
Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.
Sections are started by a header line containing the section enclosed
in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next section
or the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.
.P
Description of sections and available keys follows:
.SS [General]
This section is the only mandatory section of the configuration file.
.TP
.BI InputRequestTimeout= secs
Set input request timeout. Default is 120 seconds
The request for inputs like passphrase will timeout
after certain amount of time. Use this setting to
increase the value in case of different user
interface designs.
.TP
.BI BrowserLaunchTimeout= secs
Set browser launch timeout. Default is 300 seconds
The request for launching a browser for portal pages
will timeout after certain amount of time. Use this
setting to increase the value in case of different
user interface designs.
.TP
.BI BackgroundScanning=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Enable background scanning. Default is true.
Background scanning will start every 5 minutes unless
the scan list is empty. In that case, a simple backoff
mechanism starting from 10s up to 5 minutes will run.
.TP
.BI FallbackTimeservers= server\fR[,...]
List of Fallback timeservers separated by ",".
These timeservers are used for NTP sync when there are
no timeserver set by the user or by the service.
These can contain mixed combination of fully qualified
domain names, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
.TP
.BI FallbackNameservers= server\fR[,...]
List of fallback nameservers separated by "," appended
to the list of nameservers given by the service. The
nameserver entries must be in numeric format, host
names are ignored.
.TP
.BI DefaultAutoConnectTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of technologies that are marked autoconnectable
by default, separated by commas ",". The default value
for this entry when empty is ethernet,wifi,cellular.
Services that are automatically connected must have been
set up and saved to storage beforehand.
.TP
.BI PreferredTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of preferred technologies from the most preferred
one to the least preferred one separated by commas ",".
Services of the listed technology type will be tried one
by one in the order given, until one of them gets connected
or they are all tried. A service of a preferred technology
type in state 'ready' will get the default route when
compared to another preferred type further down the list
with state 'ready' or with a non-preferred type; a service
of a preferred technology type in state 'online' will get
the default route when compared to either a non-preferred
type or a preferred type further down in the list.
.TP
.BI NetworkInterfaceBlacklist= interface\fR[,...]
List of blacklisted network interfaces separated by ",".
Found interfaces will be compared to the list and will
not be handled by connman, if their first characters
match any of the list entries. Default value is
vmnet,vboxnet,virbr,ifb.
.TP
.BI AllowHostnameUpdates=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Allow connman to change the system hostname. This can
happen for example if we receive DHCP hostname option.
Default value is true.
.TP
.BI SingleConnectedTechnology=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Keep only a single connected technology at any time. When a new
service is connected by the user or a better one is found according
to PreferredTechnologies, the new service is kept connected and all
the other previously connected services are disconnected. With this
setting it does not matter whether the previously connected services
are in 'online' or 'ready' states, the newly connected service is
the only one that will be kept connected. A service connected by the
user will be used until going out of network coverage. With this
setting enabled applications will notice more network breaks than
normal. Default value is false.
.TP
.BI TetheringTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of technologies that are allowed to enable tethering separated by ",".
The default value is wifi,bluetooth,gadget. Only those technologies listed
here are used for tethering. If one wants to tether ethernet,
then add "ethernet" in the list.
NOTE that if ethernet tethering is enabled, then a DHCP server is
started on all ethernet interfaces. Tethered ethernet should
never be connected to corporate or home network as it will disrupt
normal operation of these networks. Due to this ethernet is not
tethered by default. Do not activate ethernet tethering unless you
really know what you are doing.
.TP
.BI PersistentTetheringMode=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Restore earlier tethering status when returning from offline mode,
re-enabling a technology, and after restarts and reboots.
Default value is false.
.TP
.BI Enable6to4=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Automatically enable Anycast 6to4 if possible. This is not recommended, as the
use of 6to4 will generally lead to a severe degradation of connection quality.
See RFC6343.  Default value is false (as recommended by RFC6343 section 4.1).
.SH "EXAMPLE"
The following example configuration disables hostname updates and enables
ethernet tethering.
.PP
.nf
[General]
AllowHostnameUpdates = false
TetheringTechnologies = ethernet,wifi,bluetooth,gadget
